(5GC) and RAN simulator","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Author: Jimmy Chang Date: 2023/7/5</p>"},{"location":"blog/20230705/1-free5gc-with-namespace/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This technique leverages namespace to run UERANSIM, an opensource 5G-UE and RAN(gNodeB) simulator, and connect to free5GC. UERANSIM follows the 3GPP specification for developing and can support multiple 5G core (5GC) including free5GC.</p> <p>Why are we using namespace? Well, you can follow ULCL and free5GC compose to set up the environment with VM and docker, but there are limitations for hardware\u2019s capability. With network namespace, you can have different and separate network instances of network interfaces and routing tables that operate independently.</p> <p>So, what is network namespace? Network namespace makes a copy of network stack with its own routing table, firewall and devices. A named network namespace is an object at <code>/var/run/netns/</code>. The file descriptor resulting from opening <code>/var/run/netns/</code> refers to the specified network namespace. Holding that file descriptor open keeps the network namespace alive.</p> <p>And how to make both namespaces communicating? A virtual Ethernet device (veth) pair provides the abstraction that can be used to create tunnels between network namespaces, and can be used to create bridge to a physical network device in another namespace. Veth pair also be used as standalone network devices. When the namespace freed, veth device which attatch to would be destroyed.</p> <p>The environment is as follow. Suppose you have already installed as well as set up free5GC and UERANSIM properly.</p> <ul> <li>free5GC v3.3.0</li> <li>UERANSIM v3.1.0</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Namespace free5GC represents host network namespace.

Additionally, the resident time, which is the message propagation delay introduced by bridges, should also be taken into account.

These timestamps are then embedded within the sync message and transmitted to the UE. Once the UE receives the sync message, DS-TT calculates the resident time by subtracting the Ingress Timestamp provided in the sync message, from the Egress Timestamp which represents the time of sync message reception. The resident time is added to the delay time mentioned in the sync message to determine the corrected time.

Each network slice provides dedicated and customized network resources to meet the specific requirements of different services The main elements of a network slice include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs): Each network slice can include a set of virtualized network functions that provide specific network capabilities and services. These VNFs can include functions like routing, switching, firewalling, load balancing, or any other network service required by the slice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Isolation and Resource Allocation: Network slicing ensures the isolation of resources between slices, preventing interference and conflicts. It allows for the allocation of dedicated and optimized resources such as bandwidth, processing power, and storage to each slice based on its specific needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Orchestration and Management: Network slice orchestration involves the creation, provisioning, and management of network slices. It involves configuring the appropriate VNFs, assigning resources, and establishing connectivity between the different components of a slice.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>NFV Enabling Network Slicing for 5G</p> <p>Take Figure 1 as an example. The first slice is designed for mobile devices such as smartphones. Such slice requires a huge diversity of VNFs, and virtual links with high speed and low latency to support the broadband service of smartphones. In 5G network, Those slices are referred to as eMBB (enhanced mobile broadband) slices.</p> <p>The second slice is designed for autonomous driving. In such scenario, extremely low latency and high reliability are paramount to ensure the vehicles' operability, smoothness and safety. To achieve low latency, some of the NFs should be deployed close to the access node,i.e. on edge cloud. To achieve high reliability, a NF should have multiple instances on available physical resources to make the slice more fault tolerant. Such slice is referred to as URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications) slice.</p> <p>The third slice is designed for massive IoT. IoT devices are expected to not move and send very small amount of data intermittently. Due to the nature of such devices, functions that handle mobiltiy and always-on connections are not needed. Such slices are referred to as mIoT (massive IoT) slices.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20230726/network_slice/#mano-architecture","title":"MANO Architecture","text":"<p>In this article, we utilize MANO network function virtualization (NFV) architecture to deploy virtual network function (VNF).

It leverages Heat, OpenStack's orchestration service, to manage the underlying infrastructure resources required by the services and handle dynamic scaling of VNFs based on traffic demands.</p> </li> <li> <p>VNF Manager: Tacker includes a VNF Manager component responsible for managing the lifecycle of VNFs. It interacts with OpenStack's compute and networking services, to instantiate and manage VNF instances.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multi-VIM Support: Tacker supports multiple virtual infrastructure managers  to accommodate different cloud platforms and environments. It can interact with OpenStack, VMware vSphere and Kubernetes and so on, enabling operators to deploy network services across heterogeneous infrastructure environments.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Tacker Architecture</p>"},{"location":"blog/20230726/network_slice/#deploy-a-free5gc-network-slice","title":"Deploy a free5GC Network Slice","text":"<ol> <li> <p>In our implementation, we install OpenStack and Tacker on two different virtual machines for resource utilization reasons, but in fact, they can be installed on the same virtual machine.</p> </li> <li> <p>we need to install OpenStack on a virtual machine. Specific details and corresponding compatibility can be found on OpenStack official website. Using devstack scripts for installation enables operators to customize the environment based on their needs, such as extra plugins (softwares that extends the functionality of OpenStack environment) and overcommit (allows deploying NFs that require more resource than existing physical resourcce) functionality. Upon completion, a web UI enabled by Horizon can be used  to access and operate on your own personalized OpenStack cloud. </p> </li> <li> <p>Install Tacker on another virtual machine, which requires four OpenStack service components, Keystone, Mistral, Barbican and Horizon. Once the installation is completed, we can register our OpenStack VIM on Tacker using <code>openstack vim register</code>command.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create two instances that will be used as images (one for control plane VNFs, one for UPF) for the VNFs that we will create. Then, <code>ssh</code> into those instances to set up the configurations for the VNFs, such as, installing required packages (go language, mongodb, libtool, etc.) and <code>git clone</code> free5GC source code. Once all the configurations are done, use OpenStack dashboard to take snapshots of these instances, which will be used as the images for VNFs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Import all the VNF descriptors (VNFD) of the VNFs we need by using <code>openstack vnf descriptor create</code> command. VNFDs should be written in accordance with TOSCA format.

The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.</p> <p>When a client employs a web browser to initiate a login via the HTTP(s) protocol, the Web server is expected to furnish the client with a JWT token in response. Subsequently, the client employs this JWT token to interact with resources by sending requests through the RESTful API (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.).</p> <p>A JSON Web Token (JWT) consists of three distinct parts. In the context of the webconsole backend, the following fields are relevant:</p> <ul> <li>Header: This section contains information about the type of token and the signing algorithm used. It often includes the \"alg\" (algorithm) and \"typ\" (type) fields.</li> <li>Payload: The payload holds the actual claims or data that are being conveyed by the token. For the webconsole backend, specific fields within this section could include:<ul> <li>Claim (JSON object)<ul> <li><code>sub</code>: identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT.</li> <li><code>iat</code>: identifies the time at which the JWT was issued.</li> <li><code>exp</code>: identifies the expiration time onor after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.</li> <li><code>email</code></li> <li><code>tenantId</code></li> <li>...(you can design the attribute yourself)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Signature: This component is created by combining the encoded header and payload with a secret key (or a public/private key pair) to ensure the token's integrity and authenticity. The signature allows the recipient to verify that the token hasn't been tampered with.</li> </ul> <p>The JWT Claims Set represents a JSON object whose members are the claims conveyed by the JWT.  The Claim Names within a JWT Claims Set MUST be unique; JWT parsers MUST either reject JWTs with duplicate Claim Names or use a JSON parser that returns only the lexically last duplicate member name</p> <p>The image depicted below illustrates the process of using jwt.io to both encode and decode JWT tokens. These tokens are segmented into distinct sections denoted by the red, purple and blue divisions, separated by periods dots.</p> <p></p> <p>Given that the Payload can be decoded using the algorithm specified in the Header, it's essential to refrain from including sensitive details like passwords or credit card numbers within it. Instead, the Payload typically holds claims and application-specific metadata.</p> <p>To maintain the security of the process, the server retains a confidential key used to validate the signature. In situations where a client endeavors to access a resource using a JWT token that possesses an incorrect Verify Signature, an error response will be generated. This stringent signature verification mechanism ensures that the authenticity and integrity of both the token and its enclosed data are upheld.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20230823/20230823/#trace-code-cont","title":"Trace Code (Cont.)","text":"<p>In <code>webconsole/frontend/WebUI/api_webui.go</code>, we can find the implementation of JWT.</p> <ul> <li><code>JWT()</code> is for encoding: <pre><code>func JWT(email, userId, tenantId string) string {\n    token := jwt.New(jwt.SigningMethodHS256)\n\n    claims := token.Claims.(jwt.MapClaims)\n    claims[\"sub\"] = userId\n    claims[\"iat\"] = time.Now()\n    claims[\"exp\"] = time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24).Unix()\n    claims[\"email\"] = email\n    claims[\"tenantId\"] = tenantId\n\n    if jwtKey == \"\" {\n        return \"\"\n    }\n\n    tokenString, err := token.SignedString([]byte(jwtKey))\n    if err != nil {\n        logger.ProcLog.Errorf(\"JWT err: %+v\", err)\n        return \"\"\n    }\n\n    return tokenString\n}\n</code></pre></li> <li><code>ParseJWT()</code> is for decoding: <pre><code>func ParseJWT(tokenStr string) (jwt.MapClaims, error) {\n    token, err := jwt.Parse(tokenStr, func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {\n        return []byte(jwtKey), nil\n    })\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, errors.Wrap(err, \"ParseJWT error\")\n    }\n\n    claims, _ := token.Claims.(jwt.MapClaims)\n\n    return claims, nil\n}\n</code></pre></li> <li>The function <code>CheckAuth()</code> serves the purpose of determining whether a user possesses the authorization to access a particular resource.</li> </ul> <pre><code>func CheckAuth(c *gin.Context) bool {\n    tokenStr := c.GetHeader(\"Token\")\n    if tokenStr == \"admin\" {\n        return true\n    } else {\n        return false\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Warning</p> <ul> <li> <p>The secret key utilized for signature verification is obtained through <code>os.Getenv(\"SIGNINGKEY\")</code>.

Before I tell you the answer directly, there is something I want you to know first.</p> <p>We know that network slicing is a technology that allows network operators to divide physical network infrastructure into multiple customized virtual network slices, and each of the slices can meet specific requirements for specific use cases.  One of the most important functions of 5G network slicing is the virtual network function (VNF). VNF is a virtualized network service running on an open computing platform. In this free5GC network slicing experiment, the VNF in our experiment is our NF in free5GC, such as UPF, NSSF, UDM... etc. When you load all your VNFs into OpenStack, it should be like this:</p> <p></p> <p>So what is VNFD? What is the connection between it and VNF? VNFD's full name is Virtual Network Function Descriptor. A VNFD is a deployment template that describes a VNF in terms of deployment and operational behavior requirements. It also contains connectivity, interface, and virtualized resource requirements. The VNFD conforms to the GS NFV-SOL 001 specifications and standards specified by ETSI. The Virtual Network Function Descriptor (VNFD) file describes the instantiation parameters and operational behaviors of the VNFs. It contains KPIs and other key requirements that can be used in the process of onboarding and managing the lifecycle of a VNF. Each VNFD template has the following fields:</p> <p></p> <p>In the deployment of free5GC network slicing experiment, if you onboard all your VNFs successfully, then your VNFD should also be like this:</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, every VNFD is matched with its represented VNF and its IP address, VNFD acts as a blueprint or template for VNF. Also be aware that The VNFD is a static description file, not a dynamic configuration file. The metadata description in the VNFD is not changed during the whole VNF lifecycle. Some VNF parameters described in the VNFD can be declared to be configurable during the VNF design phase, and further be configured by the VNFM during or after VNF instantiation.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20230906/0905-2023blog/#vnfd-architecture-and-details","title":"VNFD Architecture And Details","text":"<p>The UML representation of the VNFD high-level structure is shown in the figure below.</p> <p></p> <p>The ETSI released a specification that defines the requirements for the structure and format of a VNFD. As you can see, this graph illustrates the high\u2010level structure of a VNFD. The VNFD is composed of one or many virtual deployment units (VDUs) that describe the deployment resources and operation behavior of a VNF component (VNFC). Virtual Deployment Unit(VDU) is a basic part of VNF. It is the VM that hosts the network function. They are virtual machines that host the VNF or parts of it. Each part of the VNF is a VNFC and can be deployed on one or more VDUs. Each VDU is characterized, among other elements, by the software image loaded on it and the resources needed to deploy it. That is the flavor of Nova in OpenStack, which can set Disk, Memory, CPU, etc. An NS(Network Service) might contain different VNF. A VNF might also contain different VDU. Each level puts constraints on the subsequent levels, information in a lower level does not appear in a higher level. This is a complex and flexible architecture, very beautiful, very powerful.</p> <p>The following graph shows the composition of the virtual deployment unit in a VNFD:</p> <p></p> <p>This graph illustrates a VDU deployment view. A VDU describes mainly the virtual compute (VC), virtual storage (VS), and virtual memory (VM) resources that are necessary for deploying a VNFC, and it could be linked via connection points (CPD) to other VDUs or to external VDUs that belong to other VNFs via external CPD. Virtual links in the VNFD indicate how the VDUs are connected and via which CPD. This means that different VDUs can be connected to each other through the CPD. However, in free5GC network slicing, things might be different. For 5G's NS (network slice), since there are already many VNFs in 5G, under the 5G network slice architecture, an NS contains many VNFs, but a VNF always contains one and only VDU. We use AMF as an example, (AMF is an NF in free5GC) AMF is an important and complete function and we didn't break it into more pieces. Therefore, there are not many examples in our 5G of a VNF having many VDUs. Each VNF contains one VDU only, and the via connection points (CPD) function will no longer be used in 5G network slicing, although it is a powerful and convenient function.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20230906/0905-2023blog/#nsd","title":"NSD","text":"<p>NSD is a template file, whose parameters follow the ETSI MANO specification, used by the NFV Orchestrator (NFVO) for deploying network services (as a combination of multiple VNFs).

Just like VNFD, NSD is also a static configuration file.</p> <p>An NS is a composition of Network Functions (NF) arranged as a set of functions with unspecified connectivity between them or according to one or more forwarding graphs. As the following figure shows, the description of an NS as used by the NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) functions to deploy an NS instance includes or references the descriptors of its constituent objects:</p> <p></p> <p>As the specification mentioned in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014 V3.3.1, an NSD references at least one VNFD or one nested NSD, just like this graph has shown.

Deployment flavor is a very important concept in NSD and VNFD, therefore it needs to be explained separately. Since VNFD and NSD are not dynamic configuration files but static configuration files. Even static configuration file has their own advantages, however, they are irreversible and lack of flexibility. To overcome this problem, we have a concept called deployment flavor. While we are using these static configuration files, we can have different deployment flavors, therefore when we are deploying these static configuration files, we can have different ways to deploy them. For example, when we deploy them, we use the 10 MB memory, and we use 100 MB memory to deploy another one. In this example, while we are deploying our deployment parameters are different, then we can define it into deployment flavor. Deployment flavor helps NSD and VNFD to increase their flexibility as a static configuration file. Make sure it's not 100% unchangeable. We can deploy different types of Deployment_Flavor that case needs, like Deployment_Flavor#2, Deployment_Flavor#3, and Deployment_Flavor#4. Therefore, we can deploy different NS and VNF for different specific needs. Add some deployment flexibility as much as possible under the limitation that they are static configuration files.</p> <p></p> <p>That's it, I hope this blog article can help you learn more about 5G network slicing, even if you go back and read this previous blog post How \u200b\u200bto deploy free5GC network slicing on OpenStack now, I think you will have a clearer idea of \u200b\u200bhow the whole experiment works.

Here's an overview of the roles of each function and how data flows between them:</p> <p>1. CTF (Charging Trigger Function):    * Role: CTF is mostly integrated into network functions like PCF, SMSF, and SMF. These network functions monitor charging information and transform it into charging events, which are then forwarded to the CHF for further processing.    * Data Flow: It collects information on trigger conditions, information elements to be captured, and monitors service events, signaling, or user traffic.    * Data Transfer: The CTF forwards the generated charging events to the CHF via an SBI (Service-Based Interface) located within the core network's control plane.</p> <p>2. CHF (CHarging Function):    * Role: CHF is responsible for facilitating communication among all functions within the Converged Charging System(CCS). Its role includes receiving charging events and generating CDRs (Charging Data Records). Importantly, it can simultaneously handle both online and offline charging functions.    * Data Flow: It evaluates charging events, determines the value of requested resource usage, authorizes it, and manages subscriber account balances.    * Data Transfer: CHF and its associated functions engage in data exchanges involving various types of information.

When defining the 5G standards, it was recognized that there was a need to support various charging methods. Therefore, a new function called CHF (Charging Function) was introduced, and other functions such as ABMF, CGF, and RF from different systems were integrated into the Converged Charging System. This addition expanded the capabilities of 5G Core (5GC) charging.</p> <p></p> <p>The differences between 4G and 5G charging can be summarized as follows:</p> <p>1. Network Architecture:    * 4G: In 4G networks, charging functions are typically less integrated and may involve multiple separate components.    * 5G: 5G introduces a more integrated and converged charging system where various charging functions are unified within the Converged Charging System (CHF), allowing for more flexibility and efficiency.</p> <p>2. Charging Flexibility:    * 4G: 4G networks may have limitations in terms of charging flexibility, especially when it comes to handling different charging scenarios and services.    * 5G: 5G charging is designed to be more versatile and adaptable, capable of handling various charging models, both online and offline, for a wide range of services and use cases.</p> <p>3. Service Support:    * 4G: 4G charging systems are primarily designed for traditional mobile services like voice and data.    * 5G: 5G charging systems are built to support a broader range of services, including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), making them more suitable for diverse 5G applications.</p> <p>4. Convergence:    * 4G: Converged charging in 4G networks is often limited, and different charging models may not be as seamlessly integrated.    * 5G: 5G emphasizes the convergence of charging functions, allowing for greater consistency and interoperability across various charging scenarios and services.</p> <p>5. Charging Efficiency:    * 4G: Charging efficiency in 4G networks may vary depending on the specific implementation and the level of integration between charging components.    * 5G: 5G charging systems aim to improve efficiency by streamlining charging processes and reducing redundancy, thanks to the unified CHF.</p> <p>Overall, the key difference between 4G and 5G charging lies in the level of integration, flexibility, and support for a broader range of services and use cases in 5G networks. The introduction of the CHF in 5G brings greater convergence and efficiency to charging operations.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20230913/20230913/#chf-implementation","title":"CHF Implementation","text":"<p>Hello everyone, we are the free5gc development team.

The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network, and if one path is blocked, it can use another path to transport data, improving resilience to network failure. A common use of mptcp is: Most mobile phones today have the ability to connect to wifi or mobile networks (4G/5G), but regular TCP can't use two network resources simultaneously, and if the network we were originally using (for example, wifi) is disconnected, it cannot automatically switch to using the mobile network. Therefore, the connection at the application layer will also be disconnected. In this article, I will introduce MPTCP, including how to establish an MPTCP connection, how to start a new subflow, the ack mechanism, and the congestion control algorithm it uses.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20231004/20231004/#initiating-an-mptcp-connection","title":"Initiating an MPTCP Connection","text":"<p>MPTCP implements multi-path transmission by creating multiple subflows; each subflow is similar to a general TCP connection. Use the 3-way handshaking to establish the connection. But instead of a separate connection, the subflow is bound into an existing MPTCP session. MPTCP uses SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK packets to establish connections. But these sockets also carry the MP_CAPABLE option (in the optional field of the tcp header), which is used to verify whether the remote host supports MPTCP and exchange some information to authenticate the establishment of additional subflows.</p> <p></p> <p>RFC8684 3.1</p> <p>The above figure shows the structure of MP_CAPABLE. First, the initiator sends only 4 octets. If the listener also supports MPTCP v1, it will respond SYN/ACK, and the listener's key will be included in MP_CAPABLE. Then the initiator replies ACK, which contains the sender's key and the receiver's key. These keys are used to authenticate the addition of future subflows to this connection; all future subflows will identify the connection using a 32-bit \"token\". This token is a cryptographic hash of this key. The use of flags in the fourth octets are as follow:</p> <ul> <li>A: Indicate \"Checksum required\".</li> <li>B: It is an extensibility flag, must be set to 0.</li> <li>C: Indicate that the sender of this option will not accept additional MPTCP subflows to the source address and port.</li> <li>D through H: The flags D through H, are used for crypto algorithm negotiation.

If MP_JOIN contains a valid token, the recipient will respond with a SYN/ACK also containing an MP_JOIN option containing a random number and a truncated (leftmost 64-bit) HMAC.

As illustrated in Figure 1, a traveler presents their passport to a customs officer who then compares the passport details with information on their computer. If the passport's contents match the computer's records, you are granted passage. At the heart of authentication is this act of verification.</p> <p>In the context of the EPS-AKA' procedure, authentication occurs twice:</p> <ol> <li>Initially, the HSS provides the  to the UE. The UE then compares the received  whith its . If the  mathes the , it indicates sucessful authentication. This step verifies the authenticity of the HSS and, by extension, the network.</li> <li>In the second instance, the UE forwards the RES to the MME. The MME then compares the provided RES with the XRES. If the RES aligns with the XRES, authentication is successful. This stage confirms the authenticity of the UE.</li> </ol> <p> Figure 1.

Specification of UPF for second assumption</p>"},{"location":"blog/20231213/20231213/#result-and-conclusion","title":"Result and conclusion","text":"<p>Figures 7 and 8 show the average throughput results for three different systems at three UDP packet data rates: low (80 Mbps), medium (200 Mbps), and high (400 Mbps).</p> <p> Figure 7. Average throughput under the first assumption</p> <p> Figure 8. Average throughput under the second assumption</p> <p>Based on the graph, we can see that under the first assumption, free5GC Stage 3 with UPF-specific cuts provides higher throughput than free5GC Stage 3 with SMF/UPF-specific cuts because the former has more vCPU resources than the latter. Compared with free5GC Stage 2, the free5GC Stage 3 system is more optimized.</p> <p>Figures 9 and 10 show the average response time of the three different systems under the two assumptions. As the design of our proposed system is more complicated than that of the comparator system, the average response time becomes more modest. Under the second assumption, both systems have similar response times. However, under the first assumption, the response time of free5GC Stage 3 with UPF-specific slice is shorter because UPF has more vCPU resources.</p> <p> Figure 9. Average response time under the first assumption</p> <p> Figure 10. Average response time under the second assumption</p> <p>Figures 11 and 12 show the average CPU utilization of the two free5GC Stage 3 systems at the three data rates. Under the second assumption, there is no difference in CPU usage between the two free5GC Stage 3 systems. However, under the first assumption, the CPU usage rate is almost the same even if the number of vCPUs used in the UPF is different. However, in both assumptions, if we send more packets from the traffic generator, the CPU usage rate will be higher. This is because CPU usage depends only on the number of packets transmitted. On the other hand, the CPU usage of free5GC Stage 3 with the UPF dedicated cutter is slightly higher than that of free5GC Stage 3 with the SMF/UPF dedicated cutter, because the use of more vCPU resources results in more competitive conditions among CPUs.</p> <p> Figure 11. Average response time under the second assumption</p> <p> Figure 12. Average CPU utilization under the first assumption</p> <p>Figures 13 and Figures 14 show the average registration time in our proposed system. In free5GC Stage 3 with SMF/UPF dedicated slices, SMF does not require the choice of UPF, and thus the registration time is lower under both assumptions. Even though we provide more powerful SMF and UPF dedicated slices in free5GC Stage 3 under the second assumption, the registration process still takes longer. This is because SMF takes extra time to select UPF.</p> <p> Figure 13. Average registration time under the first assumption</p> <p> Figure 14. Average registration time under the second assumption</p> <p>Based on these results lead to the following conclusions: Under the first assumption, moving the SMF from the common slice to the dedicated slice will shorten the registration time, but it will deteriorate the performance of the UPF because fewer resources are allocated to the UPF than before. However, under the second assumption, only the registration time is affected; the performance of the UPF is not affected. This is because the functions in the control plane are no longer involved in the operation when the transfer starts. Therefore, if a large number of connections are required in a short period, moving the SMF from the common slice to the dedicated slice will be a better choice because the registration time of the system is shorter; it can handle a large number of registrations more efficiently. In addition, if users want to get better throughput and shorter response time under the first assumption, it is recommended to keep the SMF in the common slice so that more resources can be allocated to the UPF for better performance. Therefore we know we need to use different network slices based on different scenarios, which is the best proof of the convenience of network slicing.</p> <p>Network slicing is a crucial concept in 5G networks, allowing virtual network functions to form interconnected network services, with dedicated slices being evaluated to determine the best-performing configuration based on various factors. Fuchun Joseph Lin and Yu-Herng Chai described evaluating dedicated slices of different configurations in the 5G core. The text discusses the creation of a common slice and three dedicated slices in a network architecture. The performance of these systems is evaluated based on throughput, response time, CPU utilization, and registration time. The deployment of dedicated slices is experimented with using open-source projects. Moving the SMF from the common slice to the dedicated slice is recommended for handling a large number of connections efficiently. Different resource allocations to dedicated slices are also considered. The performance of the three systems is compared based on registration time, response time, throughput, resource cost, and CPU utilization. The testbed is built using the ETSI NFV MANO framework, free5GC, OpenStack, and Tacker. The goal is to evaluate the performance of different configurations of 5G core dedicated slices. The response time of free5GC Stage 3 with UPF dedicated slice is shorter under the first assumption, while a more powerful SMF in free5GC Stage 3 still takes longer during registration under the second assumption.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20231213/20231213/#about","title":"About","text":"<p>Leon Sawada</p> <p>NYCU CS Graduate student, today I introduce an article written by my professor Fuchun Joseph Lin.

If the UE is in the Idle state (CM-Idle) for a long period of time, causing the core network to lose the UE Context, the UE must also initiate this procedure. 2. Mobility Registration is a procedure that UEs must initiate when they move to a new Tracking Area (TA) that is not included in the UE's TAI List.

Therefore, a new technology has emerged that decomposes traditional telecommunications network services into a group or multiple independent, reusable, and elastic microservices (lightweight network functions), called CNF (Cloud native Network Function). Currently, telecommunications operators have begun to accelerate the adoption of cloud-native technologies. In addition to valuing their self-healing capabilities, they also hope that microservice architectures can accelerate and promote the development of new network services, while also providing a high level of granularity. However, the increasing complexity of microservices begets a challenge to traditional network performance monitoring solutions. First, the rapid development of microservices makes the utilization and maintenance of tracing frameworks increasingly burdensome. Second, microservices increase the complexity of network maintenance and create more blind spots on the network level. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to build new low-cost tracing frameworks and increase the observability of cloud-native 5G networks. This blog article will share the framework for effective network management proposed by Abderaouf KHICHANE, a PhD candidate at Orange Labs and Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, and his team.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20240221/20240221/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Dr. Abderaouf's Team Proposed 5GC-Observer as a Non-Intrusive Observability Framework for Cloud-Native 5G Network Services. The framework utilizes eBPF technology to observe the 5G core network and generate rich telemetry data, which can be used for real 5G end-users\u2019 QoS degradation detection. - [1, 2, 3] Dr. Abderaouf made use of a Kubernetes cluster composed of 3 nodes. As shown in the figure above, there is 1 master node as the control plane [1], and 2 worker nodes as the data plane [2, 3]. - In addition, they setup a VM having access to the Kubernetes cluster is dedicated to the simulation of UEs to ensure the E2E 5G workflow. Here is a brief explanation of the different parts of the figure above (We would not explain the components in detail. Please refer to the team's paper for more information.): Controller: It is used to discover the 5G microservices and their networks by periodically interacting with the Kubernetes API. it can also retrieve for each Kubernetes Pod belonging to the 5G network service, such as its name, the high level Kubernetes resources managing it, its network interfaces, and their IP addresses, etc. And it is communicated to the 5GC-Observer\u2019s Agent using a Kubernetes Custom Resource (CR). Agent: As shown in the figure above, the agents use the eBPF technology to monitor network traffic between 5G microservices. The agents are deployed on Kubernetes worker nodes and runs in privileged mode. And because of the utilization of eBPF, their solution is agnostic to the observed 5G core network and allows to retrieve rich telemetry data without having to know or access the source code of 5G CNFs. Log Server\uff1a They utilize \u201dGrafana Loki\u201d as a log aggregation system, allowing to collect, store and expose logs with HTTP API. Anomaly Detector\uff1a It is responsible for detecting anomalies in critical metrics stored in the Metric Server, including service level metrics (reported by the Agent) and system level metrics (reported by the Infra Exporter). They Proposed \u201cZscore\u201c as critical metrics for quantifying the distance between a point and the average of the dataset in function of the standard deviation. The formula of is as follow: </p> \u2200t, \u01b5score(m,t)=m(t)-avg(m,W)sd(m,W) <p>Where the \u201csd(m, W)\u201d is the standard deviation of metric m over a sliding time window W. Anomaly alerts would be triggered once the value of \u201cZscore\u201c is higher than a threshold \u03c7. They set W and \u03c7 to 10 minutes and 2 respectively. Their goals for the new framework are as follow: 1.Collect enough and rich telemetry data. 2.Use the acquired metrics to accurately detect anomalies.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20240221/20240221/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<ul> <li>Dr. Abderaouf's team proposed the \"5GC-Observer\" framework and successfully used the eBPF technology to observe telemetry data generated by the 5G core network.</li> <li>In fact, the team used a chaos engineering tool that consists in simulating network delay.

Traditional approaches to packet processing often struggle to keep up with the scale and complexity of modern cloud-native environments and 5G networks. Enter Loxilb, an innovative networking solution leveraging the power of eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter). eBPF, a game-changing technology in the Linux kernel, allows developers to customize packet processing directly in the kernel with unparalleled speed and flexibility, all while maintaining safety and stability.</p> <p>A practical application of LoxiLB's capabilities is demonstrated in the 5G core networks, where effectively managing signaling traffic is crucial for performance and reliability. For example, deploying a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) instances enhances both scalability and fault tolerance. This approach is detailed in the article \"5G SCTP LoadBalancer Using LoxiLB Applying on free5GC\", which illustrates how LoxiLB can distribute SCTP traffic among multiple AMF instances within a free5GC environment.</p> <p>In this document, I will provide a comprehensive exploration of Loxilb's architecture, its efficient use of eBPF, and the dual-pipeline design that makes it a robust choice for scenarios requiring high-performance networking and advanced load balancing.

The AMF typically triggers paging for reasons such as:</p> <ul> <li>Downlink Data Notification: SMF(Session Management Function), primarily responsible for interacting with the decoupled data plane, informs the AMF of incoming data for the UE. </li> <li>Mobile-Terminated Call: The network receives a signaling request to connect a voice or video call to UE.</li> <li>Network Events: For example, updates or emergency notifications.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/20241204/20241204/#2-generating-the-paging-message","title":"2. Generating the Paging Message","text":"<p>After receiving a paging trigger, AMF needs to determine the UE's location and reachability. It uses the UE's Registration Area(RA) or Tracking Area(TA) information stored in the AMF context to narrow down the list of gNBs or cells where the UE is likely present. The AMF uses the NG Application Protocol(NGAP) to send the paging request to these gNBs, which broadcast it over their radio interfaces.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20241204/20241204/#3-ue-response","title":"3. UE Response","text":"<p>The UE in idle mode periodically wakes up to monitor for paging messages and goes back to sleep mode if it is not intended for it, this is also known as the Discontinuous Reception(DRX) cycle. Upon recognizing its identifier in the paging message, the UE responds by initiating a Service Request procedure. This allows the UE to transition from idle mode to connected mode.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20241204/20241204/#4-re-establishing-connectivity","title":"4. Re-establishing Connectivity","text":"<p>After receiving the Service Request, the AMF: 1. Validates the Paging Context: Confirms that the UE responded to the Service Request matches the UE that the paging is triggered. 2. Retrieves UE Context: Loads the UE's mobility context and session information and also validates the request against the subscription and policy rules. 3. Manages Session Continuity: If the Service Request is for data, AMF needs to ensure the relevant PDU session is active.</p> <p>The gNB establishes a Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection with the UE, enabling the necessary radio bearers for data transfer or signaling. If the request involves downlink data, packets buffered in the User Plane Function (UPF) are delivered to the UE.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20241204/20241204/#paging-message","title":"Paging Message","text":"<p>The following is a further introduction to the paging message transmitted by the AMF via the NG-RAN(gNB) to the UE, which contains essential information to identify the UE and specify the paging cause.</p> <p>Here are some critical fields in the paging message:</p> <ul> <li>UE Paging Identity: A temporary identifier uniquely identifying the UE.</li> <li>TAI List for Paging: Specifies the areas where the paging should be broadcast.</li> <li>Paging Priority: Specifies the priority of the paging request, ensuring time-critical services(e.g. emergency calls) are handled promptly.</li> <li>Paging Origin: The source or entity in the network that initiates the paging procedure.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/20241204/20241204/#error-handling-and-paging-retries","title":"Error Handling and Paging Retries","text":"<p>Error handling and retries are also critical in the paging process to ensure reliable communication with the UE(s), especially in scenarios like network congestion, UE mobility, or poor radio conditions. Following is a simple introduction to the mechanisms and strategies for handling errors and performing retries during paging in 5G networks.</p> <p>Errors in the paging process can occur under various conditions, for example:</p> <ul> <li>UE Non-Response: The UE does not respond to a paging message due to poor coverage, signal interference, or power-saving mode misalignment.</li> <li>Incorrect Paging Area: The UE is no longer present in the area where it was last registered.</li> <li>Network Congestion: The gNB experiences a high traffic load, leading to delayed or dropped paging messages.</li> </ul> <p>To address these errors, AMF employs retry mechanisms to successfully reach the UE by applying further paging according to any applicable paging strategy. These strategies include, </p> <ul> <li>a paging retransmission scheme (e.g., how frequently the paging is repeated or with what time interval)</li> <li>determining whether to send the paging message to the (R)AN nodes during certain AMF high load conditions</li> <li>apply sub-area based paging (e.g., the first page in the last known cell-id and retransmission in all registered TAs).</li> </ul> <p>If retries fail after multiple attempts, AMF may initiate additional procedures to recover the UE's context, such as requesting its current location through network-level signaling.</p> <p>Paging errors can also result from UE mobility across the registration area. In this case, the AMF coordinates with neighboring AMFs to forward the paging result if the UE is likely to have moved to a different registration area. The previous AMF forwards the paging message to the new AMF to retry paging in the updated area.</p> <p>In cases where paging errors persist after retries, the network uses fallback mechanisms to ensure continuity.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20241204/20241204/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Paging is a fundamental procedure in the 5G network, enabling seamless communication with UEs in idle or low-power states. By combining efficient paging strategies with robust error handling, the AMF ensures reliable delivery of services while minimizing resource use. This process reflects the advanced capabilities of 5G in balancing network efficiency, battery conservation, and quality of service. Paging's intelligent design ensures that the 5G network remains responsive and adaptive to the dynamic needs of modern connectivity.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20241204/20241204/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<ul> <li>TS 23.501</li> <li>TS 23.502: Describes the overall paging and service request procedures</li> <li>TS 38.413: About NGAP messages used between AMF and gNB</li> <li>Idle Mode DRX in 5G NR</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/20241204/20241204/#about","title":"About","text":"<p>Hi, I'm Yung-Hsuan!

More details about BTF can be discovered in this comprehensive guide.</p> <p>Before the advent of Compile Once-Run Everywhere (CO-RE), developers working with eBPF had to compile an individual eBPF object for each kernel version they intended to support. This stipulation led toolkits, such as iovisor/bcc, to depend on runtime compilations to handle different kernel versions.</p> <p>However, the introduction of CO-RE facilitated a significant shift in eBPF portability, allowing a single eBPF object to be loaded into multiple differing kernels. This is achieved by the libbpf loader, a component within the eBPF's loader and verification architecture. The libbpf loader arranges the necessary infrastructure for an eBPF object, including eBPF map creation, code relocation, setting up eBPF probes, managing links, handling their attachments, among others.</p> <p>Here's the technical insight: both the eBPF object and the target kernel contain BTF information, generally embedded within their respective ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. The libbpf loader leverages this embedded BTF information to calculate the requisite changes such as relocations, map creations, probe attachments, and more for an eBPF object.

Traditional Layer 4 load balancing can lead to issues such as AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) overload and problematic handovers, especially when gNBs (next-generation Node Bs) serve a large number of UEs (User Equipments). LoxiLB overcomes these challenges by comprehending both NGAP and NAS (Non-Access Stratum) protocols, enabling effective distribution of UEs across stateless AMFs and facilitating seamless handovers. More information about this topic can be found here.</p> <p>This post provides a step-by-step deployment guide using open-source solutions like Free5GC, LoxiLB, and UERANSIM, all orchestrated in a cloud-native fashion with Kubernetes, to demonstrate this functionality.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20250306/20250306/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>LoxiLB is deployed as a load balancer in front of multiple AMFs in a Free5GC deployment to ensure high availability and seamless failover for NGAP connections originating from a gNB (UERANSIM). By proxying NGAP traffic, LoxiLB ensures that if an AMF instance goes down, the gNB's NGAP connection remains intact and continues to function without interruption. Additionally, when a failed AMF instance recovers, LoxiLB replays cached NG Setup requests, etc to restore connectivity automatically.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20250306/20250306/#flow-diagram","title":"Flow Diagram","text":"<p>1.

Since the UE sends packets only to port 2152, the NodePort method is not suitable, and LoadBalancer is designed for HTTP, not UDP traffic. The simplest solution is to configure the UPF's N3 interface to use the host-only subnet, allowing the UE to send packets directly to the N3 interface via that subnet. Alternatively, you can modify only the SMF to advertise the gNB N3 interface as the VM2 host-only IP and use a kube-proxy service to forward packets to the pod IP. This can also be addressed using MACVLAN or IPVLAN CNI plugins to bridge the UPF pod directly onto the host network.For detailed configuration and result, refer to the appendix.</li> <li>We demonstrate the UPF ULCL configuration here; for a single UPF setup, refer to the section above.</li> </ol> NF parameter current value new value AMF global.n2network.masterIf eth0 enp0s8 AMF global.amf.service.ngap.enabled false true SMF global.n4network.masterIf eth0 enp0s8 SMF interfaceType: N3 endpoints 10.100.50.233 192.168.56.19 UPF global.n4network.masterIf eth0 enp0s8 UPF global.n3network.masterIf eth0 enp0s8 UPF global.n3network.subnetIP 10.100.50.232 192.168.56.0 UPF global.n3network.cidr 29 24 UPF global.n3network.gatewayIP 10.100.50.238 empty UPF global.n3network.excludeIP 10.100.50.238 192.168.56.254 UPF global.n6network.masterIf eth1 enp0s3 UPF global.n6network.subnetIP 10.100.100.0 10.0.2.0 UPF global.n6network.gatewayIP 10.100.100.1 10.0.2.2 UPF global.n6network.excludeIP 10.100.100.254 10.0.2.254 UPF global.n9network.masterIf eth0 enp0s8 UPF upf1.n6if.ipAddress 10.100.100.13 10.0.2.13 UPF upf2.n6if.ipAddress 10.100.100.14 10.0.2.14 UPF upfb.n3if.ipAddress 10.100.50.233 192.168.56.19 UPF upfb.n6if.ipAddress 10.100.100.12 10.0.2.15 ulcl-enabled-values.yaml N3 endpoints 10.100.50.233 192.168.56.19"},{"location":"blog/20250416/20250416/#persistent-volume-for-mongodb","title":"Persistent Volume for mongoDB","text":"<p>A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes is a storage resource provisioned independently of pods, enabling data persistence across pod restarts.

It simplifies certain aspects of PTP to enable faster and more stable synchronization in local networks. gPTP also introduces the Grand Master election mechanism (BMCA), making it suitable for automotive and industrial TSN applications.

These characteristics demand new approaches to mobility management within the 5G Core (5GC) and Radio Access Network (RAN).</p> <p>This blog explores how NTN handover works, why it fundamentally differs from terrestrial scenarios, and what technical solutions are emerging to ensure seamless mobility across the sky and ground.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20250903/#why-handover-is-different-in-ntn","title":"Why Handover is Different in NTN","text":"<p>Handover in terrestrial 5G networks is already a complex process, but in NTN it becomes significantly more challenging due to the unique characteristics of satellite communication.</p> <ul> <li>Satellite Mobility: LEO satellites orbit the Earth in about 90\u2013120 minutes, so a UE may need to switch satellites every few minutes, resulting in widespread handover events compared to terrestrial networks.</li> <li>Doppler Effect: High relative velocities cause large Doppler shifts, complicating synchronization and stability during HO.</li> <li>Backhaul Constraints: Satellite feeder links may be capacity-limited or weather-dependent, influencing HO reliability.</li> </ul> <p>In short, NTN handover requires adaptations in mobility management, timing, and signaling beyond terrestrial assumptions.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20250903/#types-of-ntn-handover","title":"Types of NTN Handover","text":"<p>Handover can occur at different levels depending on the network topology and user movement to ensure seamless mobility in Non-Terrestrial Networks. The main categories are:</p> <p>1. Intra-Satellite Handover Occurs when UE switches between beams of the same satellite. Common in spot-beam architectures, where a single satellite projects multiple coverage areas to increase capacity. Like handovers in terrestrial networks, beam transitions are often more frequent due to satellite footprint movement.</p> <p>2. Inter-Satellite Handover Happens when the UE transitions from one satellite to another. Particularly frequent in LEO constellations, where satellites have fast-moving orbits and limited visibility duration. Coordinating between the NTN gateway, 5GC, and the Radio Access Network (RAN) is required to maintain session continuity.</p> <p>3. NTN to TN Handover A UE may move between terrestrial 5G and NTN coverage in hybrid deployments. This handover ensures service continuity when users travel from urban areas (dense terrestrial cells) to remote regions (served by satellites)\u2014often considered one of the most challenging scenarios because of significant differences in latency, Doppler, and scheduling strategies.</p>"},{"location":"blog/20250903/#conditional-handover","title":"Conditional Handover","text":"<p>Unlike traditional handovers where the source gNB immediately triggers a switch, Conditional Handover (CHO) allows the UE to pre-receive handover configurations and execute the switch autonomously when certain conditions are met (e.g., signal quality, timing, or position).

This evolution brings incredible benefits in scalability, resilience, and portability, allowing network functions to be deployed and scaled with unprecedented agility.</p> <p>However, this dynamic, distributed environment also introduces new challenges. With network functions running as dozens of pods across a cluster, how do we track their health? How do we measure performance, identify bottlenecks, or diagnose issues in real-time? The answer is observability. We need robust tools to collect, store, and visualize the vast amount of metrics these systems generate.</p> <p>This is where the powerful open-source duo of Prometheus and Grafana comes in. Prometheus provides a scalable and reliable time-series database for collecting metrics, while Grafana offers a flexible and intuitive platform for visualizing them.</p> <p>This blog post will serve as a comprehensive guide to integrating this monitoring stack with the <code>free5gc-helm</code> deployment.

These functionalities can be broadly categorized into three main areas: Secure Communication Setup, Authentication Protocol Handling, and Service-based Interface Management. Each of these areas plays a vital role in ensuring that the AUSF effectively secures network access and communication.</p> <p>[1] Listen and Serve : </p> <ul> <li>Once the AUSF receives an authentication request, typically from the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) as part of the 5G security procedures, it will be processed through a secure communication channel. The AUSF listens for incoming authentication requests through its service-based interface, ensuring secure and reliable transport, often utilizing protocols like HTTPS for secure transmission over the network.</li> </ul> <p>[2] Service-based interface handler for AUSF:</p> <ol> <li> <p>[2-1] UE Authentication:</p> <ul> <li>(1) EAP-AKA :  The EAP-AKA' authentication process, as detailed in RFC 5448 and 3GPP TS 33.501, is a sophisticated mechanism designed to ensure secure communication between the User Equipment (UE) and the network.

The function  <code>pfcp.handleSessionEstablishmentRequest</code> first checks whether the remote node ID has been associated with UPF, then proceeds to use the F-SEID in the request to create a PDU session in UPF control plane. Afterwards, the UPF begins creating PDU session in the data plane, by transferring information elements from the PFCP message, such as QER, FAR, and PDR, to the kernel module gtp5g. Taking QER as example, UPF call <code>pfcp.CreateQER</code>, which then calls <code>forwarder.CreateQER</code> with the purpose of providing the GTP-U driver with the QER value. Subsequently, forwarder.CreateQER utilizes the <code>gtp5gnl.CreateQEROID</code> function to establish a link with the go-gtp5gnl library. The handler within go-gtp5gnl interacts with the gtp5g module in the kernel through Linux netlink to inject the QER data. This procedure enables the data plane to enforce QoS rules within the PDU session.</p>"},{"location":"doc/Upf_PFCP/design/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>3GPP TS 29.244 : Interface between the Control Plane and the User Plane nodes</p>"},{"location":"doc/Upf_PFCP/design/#about-me","title":"About Me","text":"<p>I'm a graduate student at NYCU studying 5G core networks.
